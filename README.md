# NLP_Supply_Chain_Packaging-

This code performs sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews related to packaging. It uses two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, with TF-IDF vectorization to convert the reviews into numerical vectors. Additionally, the code integrates cross-validation (CV) for model evaluation and allows dynamic input of a new test dataset for predictions.

Output: 
Logistic Regression - Validation Accuracy: 0.87
Decision Tree - Validation Accuracy: 0.82

Cross-Validation Scores:
Logistic Regression CV Accuracy: 0.86 ± 0.02
Decision Tree CV Accuracy: 0.83 ± 0.03
